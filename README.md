# VueJS_MainProject_FindACoach

This is the **main project** of ***[a course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide)*** made to learn vue.js 3 thoroughly.

## Thanks to this project, I learned several key features including

- **Advanced routing** with *navigation guards* and redirection.
- Adding **transition** between routes.
- Using Firebase RealTime Database to **make data persistant**.
- Using Firebase Auth to **Authenticate users**.
- Taking advantage of Javascript built-in *localStorage* to implement an **Auto-Login/Auto-Logout feature**.
- **Optimizing components** by making them *asynchronous* to avoid unnecessary code loading.
- **Building and deploying** this app to Firebase hosting.
